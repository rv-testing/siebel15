MultiMonitor Search Pattern version 4.0
========================================================
Modified two scripts  srchPtrn.ksh &  srchPtrn.py for version 4 enhancements- Modified to handle multiple monitors concurrently using one configuration file srchPtrn.confg for last file positions.

This v4 script will take an additional parameter like below and it will keep track of file positions with MonitorID+FileName  in srchPtrn.confg:



Usage: $0 <Unique Monitor ID> <FILE_PATTERN with full path> <Search strings> 

where:	Unique Monitor ID required to identify last read positions for files in srchPtrn.confg
	File_PATTERN could be multiple files with full path using wild card '*' or separated by %
	Search strings could be multiple Search strings separated by % 


I have added another ksh script for initializing all variables. :

# init_srchPtrn.ksh
#initialize global variables
